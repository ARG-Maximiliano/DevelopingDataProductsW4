## About the app

<div class="red2">
The app was created to convert Euros to different currencies in the European Union. Conversion rates were taken from the **R dataset euro**. 
</div> 
After defining the amount of euros to convert and the type of currency, **the app will provide as the output the amount of money the users will get according to their inputs, expressed in the currency selected.**

<div class="green">*Conversion rates for each currency available*</div>
```{r, comment=""}
euro
```

<div class="green">*Currencies available*</div>
**Austrian Schilling** (ATS), **Belgian Franc** (BEF), **German Mark** (DEM), **Spanish Peseta** (ESP), **Finnish Markka** (FIM), **French Franc** (FRF), **Irish Punt** (IEP), **Italian Lira** (ITL), **Luxembourg Franc** (LUF), **Dutch Guilder** (NLG) and **Portuguese Escudo** (PTE)

## How the app works?

<div class="blue">**Steps required by the user:**</div>
\
1.Define the amount of euros to convert

2.Select the currency to convert from the list

<div class="blue">**Calculation of the output:**</div>
\
Amount in Euros Selected * Conversion Rate for the Currency Selected = Amount in the Currency Selected

**Example:** by default, the app is setted to convert 100 euros to Austrian Schilling (ATS), which has a conversion rate of 13.760300 ATS per 1 euro. Hence, the output will be:

```{r, comment=""}
100* euro["ATS"]
```
